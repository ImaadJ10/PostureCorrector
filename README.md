# RightAngle
  RightAngle is a posture correction program that uses computer vision to detect whether or not the user's has good or bad posture and is perfect for remote workers and students!
## Inspiration
  In the age of COVID-19, we realized how importance office ergonomics during the transition to remote work and learning. As current co-op interns, its easy for us to forget how to maintain a healthy posture as we spend the majority of our days seated at our desk. That why we were inspired to create an application to help us as well as other interns, workers, and student to create a healthy habit by correcting their posture when we are seated at our desks!
## What it does
  **Right Angle** is a program that corrects a user's posture by identifying the user's anatomy and calculates and tells the user's whether their posture should be corrected. The program first tells the user to stay in a correct posture while the program calibrates. Once calibrated, the program will signal to the user on the application whether the user has slump over and needs to correct their posture.
## How we built it
Our project uses flask to call OpenCV's API computer vision and present the model to our frontend using React.
## Challenges we ran into
- transporting our flask model from OpenCV's API to our frontend
## Accomplishments that we're proud of

## What we learned
- **OpenCV API**
- Integrationg between **Flask** and **React**
## What's next for RightAngle
