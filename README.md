# RightAngle

## Inspiration
As current co-op interns, we realized how importance office ergonomics during remote work. Many of us, its easy to forget staying in a healthy posture as we spend the majority of our days seated in a static position. That why we were inspired to create an application to help us as well as other interns, workers, and student to create a healthy habit by correcting their posture when we are seated at our desks!
## What it does
**Right Angle** is a program that corrects a user's posture by identifying the user's anatomy and calculates and tells the user's whether their posture should be corrected. The program first tells the user to stay in a correct posture while the program calibrates. Once calibrated, the program will signal to the user on the application whether the user has slump over and needs to correct their posture.
